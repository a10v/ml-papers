# Machine Learning Papers Repo

## Goal

Given the rapid pace of advancement in RL-based techniques for LLM training after the release of [Deepseek-R1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12948), this repository aims to track and archive relevant papers.

<!-- ## Archive structure

The `archive` folder will contain downloaded archives of papers and repositories, whose relative paths are linked on the `README.md`. The `archive/` path contains folders separating the topics based on their central topics. For example, the `archive/RL/` directory contains individual subfolders for each paper.  -->
